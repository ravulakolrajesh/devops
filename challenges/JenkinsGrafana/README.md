Explore the power of Nginx by setting up a reverse proxy for multiple services. Configure secure, efficient, and scalable web access.

Requirements:
Service Setup: Install and run Grafana and Jenkins locally or via Docker.

Nginx Reverse Proxy:
    Configure Nginx to route requests:
        https://grafana.local → Grafana
        https://jenkins.local → Jenkins (with Basic Authentication).

Enable SSL:
Generate and configure a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS access.
Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Secure Jenkins: Restrict Jenkins/Grafana access with Basic Authentication.

Validate Configuration: Access both services via the configured domains securely using HTTPS.

Why This Matters:
Reverse proxies are a cornerstone of cloud-native architectures, enabling secure service exposure, load balancing, and high availability. This challenge prepares you to handle real-world scenarios where Nginx is critical.

Submission Guidelines:
1. GitHub Repository: Upload your Nginx configuration, Grafana and Jenkins setup steps, and screenshots of task completion.

2. Documentation: Include a README.md explaining your approach, challenges faced, and key learnings.

3. Share Your Progress: Post your experience with hashtags: #getfitwithsagar, #SRELife, #DevOpsForAll


Bonus Tasks:

Restrict Access to Jenkins by IP:
    Use Nginx’s allow and deny directives to restrict access to Jenkins from a specific IP range (e.g., your office/home IP).
    Only allow access from your designated IP range and deny others.

Implement Rate Limiting in Nginx:
    Set up Nginx rate limiting to prevent abuse by restricting the number of requests per second from each IP address.
    Ensure that rate limits are applied for access to Jenkins.

Configure Subdomains:
    Configure Nginx to use subdomains (grafana.local and jenkins.local) instead of path-based routing.

Automate Setup with  Shell Scripts:
    Write a shell script that automates the entire process:
        Install and configure Grafana and Jenkins.
        Set up Nginx reverse proxy.
        Create and install SSL certificates.
        Configure Basic Authentication for Jenkins.
    The script should handle all the steps required to set up the environment from scratch.
